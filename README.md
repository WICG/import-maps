# Former home of import maps

This repository formerly hosted the import maps explainer, reference implementation, and issue discussion.

Import maps are now [part of the HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#import-maps). You can also read about them [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap).

You can view previous versions of [the explainer](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/blob/abc4c6b24e0cc9a764091be916c5057e83c30c23/README.md) and [the reference implementation](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/tree/abc4c6b24e0cc9a764091be916c5057e83c30c23/reference-implementation) in Git history. However, be aware that they are out of date, and do not reflect later additions to import maps after they moved to the HTML Standard, such as integrity metadata support or multiple import maps.
