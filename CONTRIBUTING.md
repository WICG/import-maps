## For maintainers: identifying contributors to a pull request

If the author is not the sole contributor to a pull request, please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than the author, which is automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If the author is  making a pull request on behalf of someone else but they had no part in designing the feature, you can remove them with the above syntax.
